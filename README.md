# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-DataSet-Prediction

Extracted 569 data from the wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set to train and predict if a new patience will be considered as Malignant or Benign based on the below independent variables

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
-3-32.Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g). concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h). concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i). symmetry
j). fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Data Set Information:

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]

Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.
